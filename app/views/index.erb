                The Toronto Star Santa Claus Fund was established in 1906 by Toronto Star Founder, Joseph E. Atkinson.Atkinson knew of poverty first-hand. His father was killed in a tragic accident when he was six months old. Left with eight young children to raise,
                his mother struggled to support the family.
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text">
                It was a very special Christmas in Atkinson's own childhood that brought out his dedication to help the poor. As the story goes, one day young Joseph was watching other children skate on the pond. A lady approached and asked him why he wasn't
                skating. When she heard his sad tale, she bought him his first pair of skates for Christmas. Atkinson never forgot the warmth and generosity of the stranger who made this Christmas Day the happiest of his childhood.
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text">
                Years later, Atkinson used The Toronto Star Newspaper to tell readers the stories of other needy children. He asked readers to contribute money, which was used to buy approximately 100 Christmas gifts.
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text">
                Just as they were in 1906, the gift boxes are still delivered to the homes of the children by volunteers such as church groups, Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, etc. One hundred and seven years later, the generosity of our readers continues to make Christmas
                a little bit happier for 45,000 less-fortunate children!
